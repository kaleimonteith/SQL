FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

#3 Find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil.  The resulting table should show the customers full name, invoice ID, date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT c.firstname, c.lastname, i.invoiceid, i.billingcountry, i.invoicedate 
FROM chinook.invoices AS i
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers AS c
ON i.customerid = c.customerid
WHERE i.billingcountry = 'Brazil';

#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agents full name,
SELECT emp.Lastname, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceID
FROM chinook.Employees emp
INNER JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepID = emp.EmployeeID
INNER JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerID = cust.CustomerID;

#6 Show the invoice total, customer name, country, and sales agent name for all invoices and customers
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
